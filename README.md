# To-do-List-App
This is a To-do list webapp created to ease your day-to-day life by keeping a track of your activities. It is a basic webapp where you can list your tasks and mark them when done. You can also remove the tasks if required.
Even if you refresh or close your browser, your data/tasks will still be there and you wont lose any of your data. I've used localStorage to add this amazing functionality. Also when you try to add an empty task it will give you apt warnings.
